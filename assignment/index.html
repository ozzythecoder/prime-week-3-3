    <!-- create an ordered list with any questions you have on this week's material -->
    <ul>
      <li>So I don't have many questions about the material, but I was wondering:</li>
      <li>I studied quite a bit on my own time before Prime. I knew the pace would be breakneck (eventually), and I was hoping to give myself as much of a headstart as possible.</li>
      <li>Not trying to brag, but I may have overdone it a bit. Since my memory of these concepts is pretty fresh, I've been knocking out each week's homework in 1-2 hours.</li>
      <li>I'm wondering, how would you recommend I keep more busy until things get a little more difficult?</li>
      <li>For your trouble: a picture of a binturong: (an animal I just found out about today!)</li>
    </ul>
